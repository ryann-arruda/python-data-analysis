# Project I

This project was carried out in a group of 3 people during the Introduction to Data Science class taught by Yuri Malheiros to test our ability to explore data.

## Group Members

1. Alexandre Bezerra de Lima (@Alexandreprog)
2. Gustavo Montenegro Maia (@guga06436)
3. Ryann Carlos de Arruda Quintino (@ryann-arruda)

## Dataset

For this project, we used a dataset about the results of international football matches. It can be found through the following link: [International football results from 1872 to 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).

## Objectives

1. Create at least 3 questions based on the dataset;
2. Explore the dataset using statistical techniques;
3. Answer the questions raised using the chosen dataset.

## Questions

1. What is the team that has scored the most penalty goals? 
2. What is the rate of goals per time?
3. Which team has won the most penalty shootouts? 
4. What is the influence of playing at home on the final result?
5. Which team has the best performance over time?
6. What is the performance of teams in official matches?
